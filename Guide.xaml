        <TextBlock Text="from sash335xi: Bro i've found a way to edit scale and position from part you can't swap the bones. Start the game go in forzavista or somewhere where you can look your car. Run 999 engine and open fh5. Run 010 Editor with the modelbin you want to edit. Go to 999 engine in the scan section, checkmark the «Hex» and use the scan type «array of byte». Now you can start with the scale or position – it’s on you which you want to beginn. Copy the 12 bytes from one (with ctrl+shift+c) an paste it in the scan field. Start scan. Now mark all addresses go in 010 and change the value how you like and copy again the 12 bytes (with ctrl+shift+c). Go in 999 engine to the marked addresses and right click change all addresses paste it there click okay and see what it’s changed in the game. When your values fits don’t forget to change in 010 all meshes. It sounds complicated but i think it’s a very fast way to edit the scales and positions if not faster than the 3dsm variant."
